Open the Spreadsheet: Open the Google Sheets spreadsheet.
Run the Script: Click on AutoFill Docs in the menu and select Create New Docs.
Check the Results: The script will generate Google Docs based on the template and populate them with the data from the spreadsheet. The URLs to the created documents will be inserted into the spreadsheet.
Notes
Ensure that the placeholders in the Google Docs template match exactly with the ones used in the script.
If there are fewer than 5 items, the placeholders for the missing items will be set to 'NULL'.
The script assumes the data in the spreadsheet is formatted correctly and separated by / where applicable.
